Module 4
## Overview of PyCity Schools Analysis
The client wanted a comprehensive analysis on the school district's reading and math scores for each high school. Due to scpeculation of academic dishonesty in the 9th grade class at Thomas High School for reading and math, the client wanted an analysis without those scores. The analysis on the school district's data for reading, math, and overall scores were reconfigured without the potential dishonest scores.
